Therefore, what better way to do that than to build my own website from the ground up? That is exactly what I did instead of relying on any of the quick-to-launch site builder platforms out there. It was designed to be minimalist and direct. The website includes a number of sections that highlights my background, skills, and experience, as well as a portfolio section that showcases my projects. By developing my own website, it allows me to keep costs low, hone my programming skills, implement my own design, and update its content with haste and ease. My website follows a mobile-first design and is built using Laravel, Blade, and PHP for the CMS back-end and HTML, CSS, and React.js for the front-end."

Users can select a country or region from a dropdown menu, and if available, select a specific territory within that region to view COVID-19 statistics such as confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. Built with Node.js, Express.js, Pug, and JavaScript, this application provides users with up-to-date information on the COVID-19 pandemic in a simple and easy-to-use manner."

By applying my passion for coding, I was able to bring one of these stories to life in a form of a text-adventure game. It features a unique story and characters, and the player's choices affect the outcome of the game. The game made use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The bulk of the story was written in JavaScript Object Notation format; it presented a great opportunity for me to strengthen my knowledge of manipulating the HTML document through the Document Object Model and practice object-oriented programming."

The MySQL database features both one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between tables. The user is able to associate and disassociate genres with their anime as well as locate anime according to the anime format (TV Series, Movies, OVAs/Specials) and genre. It was great practice for me to build an MVP of a full-stack web application."

This project allowed me to learn and practice how to build a fully functional web app with C# that was capable of C.R.U.D. and apply input sanitization to protect against SQL injection attacks. The database was created via phpMyAdmin and the web app used the ASP.NET framework. It also made use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."
